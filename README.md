# Long-Range Interdependencies Aware Signal Analysis for Rapid and Accurate Obstructive Sleep Apnea Prediction

This repository hosts the code for the paper manuscript "Long-Range Interdependencies Aware Signal Analysis for Rapid and Accurate Obstructive Sleep Apnea Prediction".

## Long-Range Interdependencies Aware Signal Analysis (LRIA)

`LRIA` folder contains the code to extract and select the inner coupling information (coupling matrices) from the raw data.

The code package is written by Matlab.

## Model training and testing on SHHS dataset

From this Google drive link, you can see the sample data: https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1-JiQKihFVLfssGcDizrpFCd1lpB_VfeD?usp=sharing

`visit_1` folder contains the sample raw data from SHHS dataset visit_1. The participants' ID are: 77, 81, 82, 83, 84.

`aout` folder contains the corresponding coupling matrices with the raw data using LRIA.

"shhs1_ahi_pruebas.xlsx" file contains the AHI level of total patients in SHHS dataset.
